        <p>A Southern favorite, these crispy, breaded, tenderized cube <br> steaks drenched in creamy gravy can be served for breakfast or dinner.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>4 (½ pound) beef cube steaks</li>
            <li>2 ¼ cups all-purpose flour, divided</li>
            <li>¾ teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1 ½ cups buttermilk</li>
            <li>1 large egg</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>3 cups vegetable shortening for frying</li>
            <li>4 cups milk</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Recipe:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Place steaks between 2 layers of plastic and pound to a thickness of 1/4 inch.</li>
            <li>Place 2 cups flour in a shallow bowl.</li>
            <li>Stir together baking powder, baking soda 1 teaspoon pepper, and 3/4 teaspoon <br>salt in second shallow bowl. Add buttermilk, Tabasco sauce, egg, and garlic; stir to combine.</li>
            <li>Heat shortening in a deep cast-iron skillet to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). <br>Place a wire rack over a sheet of parchment paper.</li>
            <li>While the shortening is heating, dredge a steak in flour to coat; shake off excess. <br>Dip into buttermilk batter; lift up so excess batter drips back into the bowl. Press <br>in flour again to coat both sides completely. <br>Place breaded steak on the wire rack and repeat to bread remaining steaks.</li>
            <li>Fry steaks, in batches if necessary, until evenly golden brown, 3 to 5 minutes per side. <br>Remove steaks to a paper towel-lined plate to drain. Cover with foil to keep warm <br>while you make the gravy.</li>
            <li>Drain fat from the skillet, reserving 1/4 cup of the liquid and as much of the solid remnants as possible.</li>
            <li>Return the skillet to medium-low heat; add the reserved oil. Whisk the <br>remaining 1/4 cup flour into the oil. Scrape the bottom of the pan with a <br>spatula to release solids into the gravy.</li>
            <li>Stir in milk, increase the heat to medium, and bring the gravy to a simmer. <br>Cook, stirring often, until thick, 6 to 7 minutes. Season with kosher salt and pepper.</li>
            <li>Transfer steaks to a platter and pour gravy over top.</li>
        </ol>
